## Intel GPU Community Issue Tracker (IGCIT)

![](img/IGCIT-logo-256.png)

**IGCIT** is a Community-driven issue tracker for Intel GPUs.

All the issues here will be reported directly to Intel.

Please, do **not** ping Intel employees in your issues.

We collect issues for **Windows only**, everything else, like Linux, must be reported to the respective developers.
We also collect issues from **emulator developers**, if you find a bug in Intel **Windows drivers**, you can report it here.

You can report Mesa issues [here](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa).
